I code with Python 2.7.6 on linux mint.
I used pandas, numpy and the standard librairy.
To execute the script just type in a terminal:

python main.py

It will create different folders but the result are in the folder "clusters".
You can switch the parameters of the k-mean function to create more or less clusters and with epsilon if you want a less regular convergence.
